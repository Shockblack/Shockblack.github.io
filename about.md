# About Me

<!--author-->

Raised in Albany, living in Milwaukee, studying in Columbus, and dreaming of San Francisco.
In my spare time I enjoy landscape photography, playing video games, watchinganime, and critiquing various local and campus coffee shops.
I also enjoy going to local concerts and music festivals like Summerfest with my friends.
