For my final project in our Astronomy 3350 course, my group and I calculated the rest spectral flux density and spectral energy distributions (SED) of quasars using multiple surveys.
This project was done alongside [Kevin Hoy], [Rachel Slaybaugh], [Simon Filbert], and Sebastian Nunez-Ceardi.
Surveys where data has been acquired from are Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE).
All of the details outlining the methodology can be found in the Jupyter notebook in the [GitHub Repository].
The notebook contains markdown for every step of the process alongside well documented code.
