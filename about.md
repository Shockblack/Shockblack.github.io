# About Me

<!--author-->

Raised in Albany, living in Milwaukee, studying in Columbus, and dreaming of San Francisco.
In my spare time I enjoy landscape photography, playing video games, watching anime, and critiquing various local and campus coffee shops.
I also enjoy going to local concerts and music festivals with my friends.

## Education
I am currently working towards my B.S. in both Physics and Astronomy at The Ohio State University.
Since the Summer of 2021 I have also been doing research within the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics.
This research has been working on creating near infrared extinction maps towards the Galactic Center, with a paper being prepared for publication.
I've been on the Dean's List every semester since attending the university.
I also won the Ann Slusher Tuttle Scholarship, a scholarship given to students nominated by faculty.

During the summer of 2022 I interned at the UC Berkeley SETI Research Center working on machine learning models.
The particular models I'm working on are Conditional Bi-Directional Generative Adversarial Networks, or cBiGANS if you're like me and can't rattle all that off.
These models are meant to create synthetic radio waterfall data to help it further find potential ETI signals.
For more in-depth details on the project, you can read about it [here](/projects/seti-ml/).

My goal is to go to grad school to get a PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics.
Recently I have found a cross section of astronomy I really enjoy and am passionate about.
The hope is to study exoplanets or other phenomenon from a machine learning angle to help automate and streamline our ability to process an ever-increasing amount of information.
I've found that I really enjoy the coding side of research and the way machine learning/neural networks operate fascinate me.

## Hobbies

As you may have noticed from the tab on the sidebar, but I love photography.
Ever since I got my hands on my friend's camera on a school trip in 2017 I had an itch to take photos.
I got my first camera (the one I still use) shortly after and have been snapping photos wherever I go since.
To date I have taken over 3,000 photos and even won a competition for one I submitted!

Another passion of mine that dates most of my life is video games.
At the age of 14 I competed in my first invite-only Counter-Strike tournament.
By 15, I was traveling to LANs and a part of a tier 3 team while competing against some of the best players in the nation.
I even got an acknowledgement by one of the tournament organizers for being a young rising star (which felt pretty cool 😁).
After the release of Valorant following the pandemic, I also competed on Ohio State's BGC Valorant roster.

Another hobby I picked up in late high school is learning Japanese!
While my ability to speak and write is poor, I am able to read manga which is clearly the most imporant use!
The first manga I read in Japanese was Volume 0 of Jujutsu Kaisen (呪術廻戦), which was way too difficult.
After that I learned my lesson and practice my reading on slice of life manga, and can do so with moderate ease!
