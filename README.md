# Aiden Zelakiewicz's Personal Website

I don't know why you're here instead of the [website] itself, but hello I guess!
This website uses the [Hydejack] Jekyll template, so huge shoutouts to the creator of that.
I wanted a clean looking website that was very customizable and could host all of my professional and personal interests on it.
