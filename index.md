My name is Aiden Zelakiewicz and welcome to my personal site!
I wanted a hub for everything I do, be it professional or personal.

Here you can find a few pages which all host various things about me.

* [Projects]{:.heading.flip-title} --- All of my research, classwork, and personal projects are on display. All of the code for each project can be found there too, as I leave it all open source (even if it's messy ðŸ˜Š).
* [About Me]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Learn more about me and my work/hobbies.
* [Photography]{:.heading.flip-title} --- A page to see various photos taken by me from my travels.
